Task 1: Build the Main Landing Page with Integrated Content and Contact Form
Description:
Develop a modern, fully responsive landing page that highlights your AI SaaS product (an automatic blog generator and uploader) and provides key information to the user. This page should include:

Hero Section:

A bold headline emphasizing the AI-driven benefits.
A strong CTA button labeled “Get Started” that, when clicked, scrolls down smoothly to the Pricing section.
Fixed-Top Animated Navbar:

Include the following items: About Us, Pricing, Blog, Contact Us, and Get Started.
Ensure smooth scrolling for in-page sections (About Us, Pricing, Contact Us) and proper navigation for the Blog section.
Content Sections:

About Us: A multi-column layout describing the company’s vision and the benefits of the AI system.
Pricing: Responsive cards showcasing various subscription tiers with hover effects and animations. Each plan should have a “Buy Now” button that links to the Payment Form Page (Task 2).
Contact Us: A contact form that stores submitted messages in Firebase (include a code placeholder such as /* Firebase code to store contact message goes here */).
Default Blog Previews: A section with hard-coded blog previews that include titles, short snippets, and “Read More” buttons linking to the blog section (Task 3).
Design & Animations:

Use the white-and-purple color scheme with background colors #dfdefd or #aba7fd.
Incorporate smooth fade-ins, hover transitions, and micro-interactions to create a premium, dynamic feel.
Ensure every element is fully visible on page load using proper Bootstrap containers, rows, and columns.
Task 2: Build the Payment Form Page for Purchasing a Plan
Description:
Develop a Payment Form Page that users access when they click “Buy Now” on a pricing plan. This page should:

Payment Form:

Present a form to collect standard user details such as Name, Email, Phone Number, and Payment Information (e.g., credit card details).
Implement form validation to ensure that all fields are correctly filled out (e.g., required fields, proper email format).
Submission and Feedback:

When the form is submitted, display a “Payment done successfully” message.
Store the submitted details in your database (include a comment placeholder such as /* Firebase code to store payment details goes here */).
Design & Consistency:

Maintain the same white-and-purple theme and animated style as the landing page.
Use responsive Bootstrap layout components to ensure the form is fully visible on all devices.
Incorporate smooth animations for form transitions and button hover effects.
Task 3: Build the Public Blog Flow
Description:
Develop the entire blog section of the website, ensuring that all users can view blogs without needing to log in. This flow should include:

Blog Sector Selection Page:

Create a page with four animated tiles, each representing a blog sector: Edtech, Fintech, SAAS, and Social Media.
Each tile should have a distinct color (complementing the overall theme) with hover effects (e.g., scale-up, shadow).
Include an engaging header (e.g., “Explore Blogs by Sector”) that fades or slides into view.
Clicking on a tile should navigate the user to the corresponding Sector-Specific Blog Main Page.
Sector-Specific Blog Main Page:

Display a dynamic header reflecting the selected sector (for example, “Fintech Blogs”).
Arrange multiple blog preview cards in a grid layout, each card featuring a title, snippet, and a “Read More” button.
Incorporate hover animations (scaling, shadows) and scroll-triggered fade-ins.
Include hard-coded example blogs so that content is available by default.
Dedicated Blog Post Page:

Create a detailed page for displaying the full content of an individual blog post.
Include a prominent title, publication date, author details, and complete blog content with images/media that animate into view.
Provide a “Back to Blogs” button or breadcrumb navigation to return to the Sector-Specific Blog Main Page.
Navigation Consistency:

The fixed-top animated navbar should be present on all blog pages, with the Blog menu item directing back to the Blog Sector Selection Page.
Ensure that the design, color scheme, and animations are consistent with the rest of the website.
